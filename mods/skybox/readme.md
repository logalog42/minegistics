### Usage

The `skybox` privilege allows players to change their own sky boxes.
The command allows listing, and changing skyboxes, or turning skybox
settings `off`.

### API

The `skybox` handle can be used to perform various actions:

`skybox.clear(player)`
 -- Reverts the player skybox setting to the default.

`skybox.set(player, number)`
 -- Sets the skybox to the `number` in the list of current skyboxes.

`skybox.add(skyboxdef)`
 -- Add a new skybox with skyboxdef to the list of available skyboxes.

`skybox.get_skies()`
 -- Get a list of availiable skyboxes
 -- Example value of `skybox.get_skies()[1]`:
 --[[
     ```lua
    {"DarkStormy", "#1f2226", 0.5, { density = 0.5, color = "#aaaaaae0", ambient = "#000000",
    	height = 64, thickness = 32, speed = {x = 6, y = -6},}},
	```
 ]]


```
skyboxdef = {
	[1] -- Base name of texture. The 6 textures you need to
	    -- provide need to start with this value, and then
	    -- have "Up", "Down", "Front", "Back", "Left" and
	    -- "Right", Followed by ".jpg" as the file name.
	[2] -- Sky color (colorstring)
	[3] -- Day/Night ratio value (float - [0.0, 1.0])
